# Freds-Spring-RPG-Engine
A console based RPG engine for Spring. Later 2.0 will be made to integrate with Angular.

## Features
Currently, the core features are still a work in progress.

## Unimplemented (Future updates)
Play Mode, where the user can play any created levels/stages, keep track of their total currency, and have an inventory of any equipment obtained.

Create Mode, where the user can create encounters, equipment, characters, monsters, and so on. Later they will be able to create "stages" which are a series of encounters with a reward at the end.

## Setup
Again, entirely server side using Spring, so you should be able to just plug and play using STS! All output to the user is in the console at the moment.
